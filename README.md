# Welcome to my "Digital Garden" 👩‍🌾

Personal knowledge base, a collection of everything I have learned.

I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) to manage my notes.
I also write [blogs](https://medium.com/@maneesh29s) derived from some of the notes present in this vault.

All the content of this website is present in raw markdown format in [this repo](https://github.com/maneesh29s/digital-garden-notes)
The published digital garden is hosted using github pages [here](https://maneesh29s.github.io/digital-garden-publish/)

Whatever I have written in this garden is my own understanding, and I will be very happy if you can point out mistakes in my notes and correct me.

If you are just here to explore, I would highly recommend my recently learned topics, [Linux Container Ecosystem](./LinuxContainers/) and [Security](./Security/). They also have some fancy mermaid diagrams in them :)
