# Welcome to my "Digital Garden" üë©‚Äçüåæ

Personal knowledge base, a collection of everything I have learned.

I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) to manage my notes, and [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to publish it online on my github.io website

Some of the knowledge I have gained as a part of [e4r](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in/clients/engineering-research)

I also write [blogs](https://medium.com/@maneesh29s) derived from some of the notes present in this vault.

All the content of this website is present in raw markdown format in [this repo](https://github.com/maneesh29s/digital-garden-notes)

The published digital garden is hosted using github pages [here](https://maneesh29s.github.io/digital-garden-publish/)
