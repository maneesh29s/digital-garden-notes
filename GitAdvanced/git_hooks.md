# Hooks

**Hooks are local to a git repo** they are *not* copied over to the new repository when you run `git clone`  
In shared dev team, typically hooks are stored in the project directory itself in a seperate `hooks` directory, which is version controlled.  
A new dev needs to either symlink or copy `hooks` to local `.git/hooks`

Sample hook files are by default generated by git in a git repo in the directory `.git/hooks` . The `.sample` suffix of the filenames prevent them from executing

==Hooks are simple executable scripts==, by default `sh`, but can be written in any scripting language using `#!/usr/bin/env <executable>`

## Client Side (local) Hooks

* `pre-commit`
* `prepare-commit-msg`
* `commit-msg`
* `post-commit`
* `post-checkout`
* `pre-rebase`

## Server Side Hooks

* `pre-receive`: called once before receiving the pushed changes
* `update` : called every time before a `ref` is updated i.e. before every commit being added to remote repo
* `post-receive`: called once after the `push` for all refs is completed
