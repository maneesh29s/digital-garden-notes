# Bitonic Sort

## Bitonic Sequnce

A **bitonic sequence** is a sequence of numbers in which, at first, the numbers are in strictly increasing order, and after a certain point, they are strictly decreasing till the end of sequence.  
The sequence {1,3,5,7,5,3,1} is a bitonic sequence as the sequence first increases to 7 and then decreases to 1.
