Good way to represent tensor contraction in higher dimensional tensors  
[Roger Penrose](../People/Roger_Penrose.md)'s phd thesis was on tensors

## tensor train technique

One can reduce an N-order tensor (containing exponentially many trainable parameters) to a chain of N tensors of order 2 or 3, which gives us a polynomial number of parametersone can reduce an N-order tensor (containing exponentially many trainable parameters) to a chain of N tensors of order 2 or 3, which gives us a polynomial number of parameters
