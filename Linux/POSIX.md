# POSIX

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX>

POSIX stands for **Portable Operating System Interface**.

It's a family of standards specified by IEEE for maintaining compatibility among operating systems

POSIX defines both the system and user-level APIs, along with command line shells and utility interfaces

## POSIX Oriented Operating Systems

Some of the famous OS are mentioned below.

### Certified

* macOS (since 10.5 leopard)

### Mostly POSIX-compliant

* Linux
* Android
* OpenBSD
* OpenSolaris

### POSIX for Microsoft Windows

* [Cygwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin "Cygwin") provides a largely POSIX-compliant development and run-time environment for [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows").
* [MinGW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW "MinGW"), a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) "Fork (software development)") of Cygwin, provides a less POSIX-compliant development environment and supports compatible [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)")-programmed applications via [Msvcrt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Msvcrt "Msvcrt"), Microsoft's old Visual C [runtime library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library "Runtime library").
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux "Windows Subsystem for Linux"), also known as WSL, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 using a Linux image such as Ubuntu, Debian, or OpenSUSE among others, acting as an upgrade and replacement for Windows Services for UNIX
