# Functional Programming

## What is it?

"Refactor what you know about programming"

Functional programming is just another paradigm of organising your existing variables, ifs, loops, namespaces, arrays, data structures etc., in a different way than OOP

## Inspiration

From mathematical functions.  
**For a given input to a function, always produce the same output**

## Rules

1. All functions must be [Pure Functions](pure_functions.md)
1. All **variables must be immutable**
1. The language should include appropriate [bridges](bridges.md) to perform operations [side_effects](side_effects.md)

## Languages

1. Haskell
1. Clojure

## Advantages

1. Useful for implementation of multi threaded program

See how [category_theory](category_theory.md) relates to this
