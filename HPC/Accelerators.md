# Accelerated Computing

GPU  
Custom Chips  
FPGA

## GPU

Distributed load across thousands of cores.  
Refer [Working of GPU](gpu_working.md) and [gpu programming paradigms](gpu_programming.md)

## Custom Silicon

Fastest, but Extremely difficult and expensive to implement

**Steps involved**

1. develop design
1. simulate
1. prototype
1. silicon conversion

## FPGA: programmable hardware

Custom hardware

More on this in [FPGA](../FPGA/fpga.md)

**Ways to program FPGA**

1. Hardware design - HDL - core electronics and VLSI
1. High level synthesis (HLS) - C to RTL (Resistor Transistor Logic)
1. OpenCL based abstraction
