# X.509 Certificates

Main reference: [RFC5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280)

Also refer to my repository [openssl cert commands](https://github.com/maneesh29s/openssl_cert_commands/tree/main) to see example codes for generating X.509 certificates, with various combinations of CAs and CSRs

## Contents of a certificate

See the [section 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1) for a list of all fields in a X.509 certificate.

The important fields (from algorithmic POV) are:

1. signatureAlgorithm and signatureValue
1. subjectPublicKeyInfo

Along with that, a certificate may contains [extensions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2), like [Key usage](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3).

## Algorithm support

Main reference: [RFC3279](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3279)  
Above reference contains which key usage extension is expected for each algorithm.

**About static DH key support**

In theory, "DH key exchange" certificates are possible but they aren't used (almost at all)  
See [why dh can't be used for signing?](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/835/why-cant-diffie-hellman-be-used-for-signing) and [static dh with openssl](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/19452/static-dh-static-ecdh-certificate-using-openssl)  
Even openssl doesn't directly support DH keys (without using `-force_pubkey` ).  
Today many systems have moved to [TLS 1.3](tls.md#TLS-1.3) (which remove static keys altogether) or use TLS 1.2 with ephemeral keys.

## Key usage extension

The [Key usage extension](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3) determines for what purposes the public key of the subject can be used. Key usage restricts the use to some applications. But if this extension is absent, the key can be used without any restrictions.  
e.g. RSA keys can (in theory) be used for key encipherment and for authentication (signature). If RSA public key is present in the certificate, we can restrict its usage with this extension.

Structure of Key usage extension is as follow:

````sh
KeyUsage ::= BIT STRING {
           digitalSignature        (0),
           nonRepudiation          (1), -- recent editions of X.509 have
                                -- renamed this bit to contentCommitment
           keyEncipherment         (2),
           dataEncipherment        (3),
           keyAgreement            (4),
           keyCertSign             (5),
           cRLSign                 (6),
           encipherOnly            (7),
           decipherOnly            (8) }
````

In a [Certificate Requests](pki.md#Certificate-Requests), the subject can also request for specific `KeyUsage` extensions.  
The [Certificate Authority (CA)](pki.md#Certificate-Authority) ==has the final say== on which `KeyUsage` to allow.
