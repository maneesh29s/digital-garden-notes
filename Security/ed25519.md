# Ed25519 Signature Algorithm: A Detailed Explanation

## Introduction

Ed25519 is a modern, high-security, and efficient digital signature algorithm based on **Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)**, using the twisted Edwards curve **Curve25519**. It is widely used due to its **fast signing, fast verification, and resistance to side-channel attacks**.

## Key Components

* **Curve25519**: An elliptic curve defined over a finite field.

* **SHA-512**: A cryptographic hash function used for hashing keys and messages.

* **Clamping**: A process that ensures certain properties of private keys to improve security.

## Key Generation

Ed25519 generates a **key pair (public key, private key)** as follows:

1. **Generate a 32-byte random seed**: Let this be $sk$.

1. **Derive a 64-byte private key**:
   
   * Compute the SHA-512 hash of $sk$: $$h = \text{SHA-512}(sk)$$
   
   * Split $h$ into two 32-byte halves: ($h_L$, $h_R$)
   
   * Modify $h_L$ (clamping):
     
     * Set the first 3 bits to zero: Ensures small subgroup attacks are avoided.
     * Set the second-most significant bit: Ensures group order is prime.
1. **Compute the public key**:
   
   * Interpret $h_L$ as an integer and multiply it by the generator point **G**: $$P = h_L \cdot G$$
   * The point **P** on the curve is actually represented as X and Y coordinates (32 bytes each). Many times, the Y cordinate is discarded and ==public key is just the X coordinate.==

## Signature Generation

Given a message $M$, and the two halves $h_L \text{ and } h_R$ derived from private key,  the signature is computed as follows:

1. **Compute the nonce**:
   
   * Compute: r $$r = \text{SHA-512}(h_R || M) \mod q$$
   * Compute the nonce point R: $$R = r \cdot G$$
   * Here also, only X coordinate of R is considered #toverify.
1. **Compute the challenge hash**:
   
   * Concatenate $R$, $P$, and $M$: $$k = \text{SHA-512}(R || P || M) \mod q$$
1. **Compute the final signature value**:
   
   * Compute: $$S = (r + k \cdot h_L) \mod q$$
   * The signature is concatenated R and S, i.e. **(R, S)**. Its length is 64 bytes #toverify .

## Signature Verification

Given a public key $P$, a message $M$, and a signature $(R, S)$, the verification process is:

1. **Compute the challenge hash**:
   
   * Compute k: $$k = \text{SHA-512}(R || P || M) \mod q$$
1. **Verify the signature equation**:
   
   * Check if: $$S \cdot G = R + k \cdot P$$
   * If true, the signature is **valid**; otherwise, it is **invalid**.
   * **Why does this work?**$$ \begin{aligned}
S \cdot G &= (r + k \cdot sk) \cdot G \\\\
   &= r \cdot G + k \cdot sk \cdot G \\\\
   &= R + k \cdot P
\end{aligned} $$

## Security Features

* **Fast & Efficient**: Uses **small, constant-time operations**, making it resistant to timing attacks.

* **Collision Resistance**: Uses **SHA-512** to hash inputs.

* **No Side-Channel Leaks**: Protects against **branch prediction & cache timing attacks**.

* **Deterministic Signatures**: Prevents **nonce reuse attacks**.
